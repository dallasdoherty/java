The game of life branch contains my java program for Conway's game of life described below:

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970. A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells where each cell can be in one of a finite number of states. In the Game of Life, each cell is either alive or dead.

The cells are initialized to some state at time  and then change their state at discrete time intervals  called generations; we say that the state of the cells evolve from generation to generation.

The state of each cell is determined by its neighbors according to a set of rules. Different variations of the game are produced by changing the set of rules.
